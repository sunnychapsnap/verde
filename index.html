                       the week of our wedding. The results were beautiful and exceeded my 
                       expectations. Her prices are very reasonable, and unlike other florists, 
                       she did not pressure us to spend more or purchase more items. I highly

                       grass...very unique. The wedding bouquet had big sunflowers mixed in 
                       with natural grasses in a natural, free flowing shape. Sandy drove 
                       to our location to drop off flowers, which was so sweet as we were 
                       overwhelmed with other wedding details. Such a sweet, and talent

            Recognizing the demand for affordable, socially-responsible flowers,
            Verde Natural Florals creates weddings and events that are beautiful
            and eco-friendly, yet reasonably priced and customized to fit your

          <p>
            With a horticultural background and a longtime passion for flowers 
            and gardening, I specialize in designs that are garden-inspired and 
            that use locally-grown, seasonal flowers, herbs and foliage whenever 
            possible.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I will work closely with you to bring your ideas and personality into
            your event, mindfully crafting each arrangement and bouquet in a 
            unique and sustainable way. I will help guide your ideas to fruition, 
            ensuring the flowers are a true reflection of you and your special 
            event.
          </p>

          <p>
            Verde Natural Florals believes that fresh, natural and organic 
            flowers do not have to be out of your price range. We can create a 
            wedding or event that is simple, elegant and original, while remaining 
            respectful of both mother earth and your budget.
